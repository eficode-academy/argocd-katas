# Exercise: Deploying helm charts with Bitnami

## Learning Goals

- Deploy Jenkins using Helm with custom values.
- Modify Helm values for customization.
- Put helm values in a values file utilizing multi-source.

## Introduction

### Multi-source deployment in ArgoCD

<summary>:bulb: Example</summary>

```yaml

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: student-0-jenkins
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  # Reference to the project name.
  project: default

  # Define the destination cluster for this application.
  destination:
    # The namespace the application should be deployed to.
    namespace: student-X
    # Specify the name of the destination cluster, either name or server url.
    name: in-cluster

  # Define the synchronization policy for the Application.
  syncPolicy:
    automated: {}

  # Define where the application will fetch its source from.
  sources:
    # Specify the repository URL for the Helm chart.
    - repoURL: 'https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami'
      # Specify the target revision of the helm repository.
      targetRevision: 12.4.0
      # Specify the name of the Helm chart as "Jenkins".
      chart: jenkins
      helm:
        # Reference the values file for the Helm chart in another repository.
        valueFiles:
          # Include a values file from a location specified by a variable "$values".
          - $values/jenkins/values.yaml

      # Specify the second source; URL for the Git repository.
    - repoURL: 'https://github.com/<YOUR GIT REPO>/argocd-katas'
      # Specify the branch of the Git repository.
      targetRevision: main
      # name this source "values" for reference in the above source.
      ref: values

## Exercise

### Overview

In this exercise, you will:

- Deploy Jenkins in the ArgoCD UI using Bitnami Helm chart.
- Change the source of the deployment file.
- Write a multi-source deployment file.
- Change the values in the deployment file for automatic changes to the Jenkins app.

### Tasks

**Deploying Jenkins with Bitnami Helm**
- Look into the repository site to see that a repository called `bitnami` with the URL `https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami` is there.
- Click on `Applications` in the navigation bar.
- Click on `New App` to create a new application.
- Fill in the following details:
  - **Application Name**: `<your name>-jenkins`
  - **Project Name**: `default`
  - **Sync Policy**: `Automatic`
  - **Repository Type**: `Helm`
  - **Repository URL**: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami (or select from the dropdown)
  - **Chart**: `Jenkins`
  - **Version**: `12.4.0`
  - **Cluster**: `in-cluster` or `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
  - **Namespace**: `<your namespace>`

Under the helm parameters, you can see that there are a lot of parameters that can be customized. We will be customizing one of them.

- Find `service.type` and change it to `NodePort`.
- Find `persistence.enabled` and change it to `false`.
- Find `jenkinsPassword` and change it to `student`.
- Click on `Create`.

- Click on the application to see the details.
- Find the http nodeport by clicking on the `studentx-jenkins` service.
- Access the Jenkins site by going to `http://<node-ip>:<nodeport>`. You can find the external node IP by running `kubectl get nodes -o wide`.

**Customizing the Jenkins deployment with a values file**
We will change the values of the Jenkins deployment by using a values file. This is useful when you want to keep your values in a separate file and not in the ArgoCD UI.

- Look at the `values.yaml` file in the `jenkins` directory. You can see that the `service.type` is set to `NodePort`, and two other values.
- Now find the manifest in the ArgoCD UI by clicking on `app details`.
- Change your manifest in ArgoCD in to use the `values.yaml` file by changing `source` to `sources` like the following:

``` yaml
project: default
destination:
  namespace: student-X
  name: in-cluster
syncPolicy:
  automated: {}
sources:
  - repoURL: 'https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami'
    targetRevision: 12.4.0
    helm:
      valueFiles:
        - $values/jenkins/values.yaml
    chart: jenkins
  - repoURL: 'https://github.com/<YOUR GIT REPO>/argocd-katas'
    targetRevision: main
    ref: values
```
ðŸ’¡ Remember to add your own repo to the file as well, as seen on the bottom. Pay attention to formatting.

- Click save.

> :bulb: It might also be that the application has a hard time syncing the new pod. You can try to delete the replica set and see if it works. If not, you can delete the application and try again.


- Try to change something in the `values.yaml` file, push it up, and see that the application is synced automatically. If you lack inspiration, you can change the `service.type` to `ClusterIP` and see that the service is now a ClusterIP service.
